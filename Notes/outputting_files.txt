How does one output a dile from an R script?

Should I ...

- Save it to the nextflow working directory by using the builtin commands to get the working directory and pass this as an argument to the R function. 

    -And then output the path string from the R script?
    -Or will it know where the output is and I just have to state 'file xyx' in the 'output:' block
    -
